<h2>Files</h2>
<p>To open a song, select the pokecrystal-based *.asm song file from within your project directory. The editor will first locate your project's Makefile by checking the directory of the selected *.asm file and checking every parent directory until the Makefile is found. This is treated as the root of your project for the sake of loading your project's custom channel 3 waveforms and channel 4 drumkits.</p>
<p>The locations checked, in order of priority, for the waveforms are:</p>
<ul>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(crysaudio)" DIR_SEP R"(wave_samples.asm</li>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(audio)" DIR_SEP R"(wave_samples.asm</li>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(wave_samples.asm</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly, for the drumkits:</p>
<ul>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(crysaudio)" DIR_SEP R"(drumkits.asm</li>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(audio)" DIR_SEP R"(drumkits.asm</li>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(audio)" DIR_SEP R"(drumkits_0f.asm (for pokepinball)</li>
<li>.)" DIR_SEP R"(drumkits.asm</li>
</ul>
<p>Creating a new song will immediately prompt to choose a project directory (unless a song is already open) so that channel 3 waveforms and channel 4 drumkits can be loaded.</p>
<p>Next is the Song Options dialog window. This dialog window specifies:</p>
<ul>
<li>The title of the song</li>
<li>Whether the song loops</li>
<li>Which channels are used in the song</li>
<li>The loop point for each channel (if applicable)</li>
<li>The end point for each channel</li>
</ul>
<p>Use the "Synchronize Channels" checkbox to keep the loop point and end point for all channels locked together.</p>
<p>The default unit of measurement for loop point and end point is a "beat". This is rather intuitive but may not be precise enough for song lengths more granular than a beat.</p>
<p>The alternate unit of measurement is a "tick" — the smallest time step in the audio engine. This is good for having the greatest level of control but, admittedly, is a bit annoying to work with.</p>
<p>One beat is equal to 48 ticks. The number of beats can be converted to number of ticks by multiplying the number of beats by 4 sixteenth notes per beat multiplied by the default speed of 12 (ie, 12 ticks per sixteenth note). So for example, the default end point is: 64 beats × 4 sixteenth notes per beat × 12 ticks per sixteenth note = 3072 ticks — which is exactly 16 measures at a 4/4 time signature.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When loading a file, if some pattern of notes is called by multiple channels then this pattern will be duplicated in-memory so that each channel is entirely independent. This has the side effect of creating duplicate labels in the file when re-saved. These duplicated labels will have to be fixed afterward in a text editor. This only has to be done once for a particular song that is affected by this.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When saving a file, the song data is serialized and no comments or formatting details from the original file are preserved.</p>

<h2>The Timeline</h2>
<p>Once a song is loaded, the editor's timeline is filled with the notes for all channels. The channels are color-coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#d90000"><b>Red: Channel 1</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#0075fd"><b>Blue: Channel 2</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#00a500"><b>Green: Channel 3</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#7c3c19"><b>Brown: Channel 4</b></font></li>
</ul>
<p>Inner loops and calls are shown with color-coded boxes that wrap the notes. Light boxes are loops and dark boxes are calls. When no channel is selected, all wrapper boxes for all channels are shown at once. When a channel is selected, only the selected channel's wrapper boxes are shown; wrapper boxes for all other channels are hidden and their notes become colored outlines.</p>
<p>If all channels' end points are the same, this point is shown with a white or black line (depending on theme). If at least one channel's end point is different than the others, each individual channel's end point is shown with a color-coded line. The same applies to the loop points, if the song loops. Unreferenced labels are shown with a gray line.</p>
<p>If the song loops and the loop points or end points are not exactly the same for all channels, then the shorter channels continue to repeat their main loop until such a point that all channels arrive at the beginning of their loop at the same time (ie, until the song truly repeats). These repeated notes have a thick gray border and cannot be selected or edited. This repeating may continue for an exceptionally long time if the lengths of the channels' main loops have a large least common multiple.</p>
<p>If a channel is selected, some of the notes for that channel may have color-coded "flags" attached to the note which indicate that the note is played with some different settings than the previous note. The flags are color-coded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><font color="#00ecec"><b>Cyan: Speed</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#ec00ec"><b>Magenta: Volume envelope</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#ecec00"><b>Yellow: Vibrato</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#ff8000"><b>Orange: Duty cycle, wave, or drumkit</b></font></li>
<li><font color="#808080"><b>Gray: Other ("Advanced")</b></font></li>
</ul>

<h2>Playback</h2>
<p>The menu bar is extremely useful as a reference for all the keyboard shortcuts.</p>
<p>For example, the Play menu shows that the song can be played/paused with the Spacebar and stopped with the Escape key.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> When editing note properties (which is explained in more detail below), Spacebar will not play the song while a property text box is selected. The text box can be deselected by pressing Escape.</p>
<p>If the song loops, a warning will be shown if any of the channels have different settings at the start of the second iteration of the main loop than it had on the first iteration. To ensure the second iteration uses the same settings as the first, explicitly set the properties at the start of the loop. This can be done by changing the property value and then changing it back (not with Undo). If the different settings on the second iteration are intentional, the warning can be toggled off with the Play&nbsp;→&nbsp;Loop&nbsp;Verification checkbox.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Playback is reasonably accurate but does not sound exactly how it sounds on the Game Boy. Things like tempo, volume fade, vibrato, etc, are only approximations.</p>
<p>The playhead (yellow or magenta line, depending on theme) can be moved with the mouse. Middle-click or hold )" COMMAND_KEY R"( and right-click to move the playhead. This is useful for starting playback at a specific point rather than playing from the very beginning.</p>
<p>While the song is playing, left-click anywhere on the timeline to toggle continuous scroll mode.</p>
<p>Left-click on the piano keys on the left to hear any note on-demand. These interactive notes currently always play a 50% square wave at full volume.</p>
<p>Each channel can be individually muted in order to focus on only specific channels. The mute statuses for each channel are also shown in the status bar at the bottom, which also act as buttons to toggle the mute status.</p>
<p>If a channel is selected (explained below), "Step Backward/Forward" moves the playhead by the selected channel's <i>speed</i> at that point. "Skip Backward/Forward" moves the playhead to the start/end of the note or rest (of the selected channel) at the playhead's current position.</p>
<p>If no channel is selected, "Step Backward/Forward" moves the playhead by the current grid spacing while "Skip Backward/Forward" moves by four times that distance.</p>

<h2>Editing</h2>
<h3>Selecting Notes</h3>
<p>Before anything can be edited, a channel must be selected. Only the currently selected channel can be edited. Channels can be selected with the 1, 2, 3, and 4 keys, as well as )" TAB_SYMBOL R"( and )" SHIFT_KEY_PLUS TAB_SYMBOL R"( to cycle through the channels. Selecting the same channel which is already selected will deselect it and editing will essentially be disabled.</p>
<p>Left-click on a note (of the selected channel) to select the note. Hold )" COMMAND_KEY R"( while clicking to add (or remove) the note to (or from) the current selection. Hold )" SHIFT_KEY R"( while clicking to select all notes between the left-most selected note and the right-most selected note. Left-click and drag to select multiple notes at once. )" COMMAND_KEY R"( and )" SHIFT_KEY R"( can also be used while dragging.</p>
<p>The Enter key can also be used to select the note at the playhead. )" COMMAND_KEY R"( and )" SHIFT_KEY R"( work the same in combination with the Enter key.</p>
<p>"Select All" is useful for quickly changing the entire channel, such as moving the entire channel up or down.</p>
<h3>Editing Notes</h3>
<p>The menu options under Edit&nbsp;→&nbsp;Selection… can be used to manipulate the selected notes. Each menu option is only available if the operation would succeed for all selected notes. If the operation would fail for any of the selected notes, such as "Octave Up" on a note which is already in the highest octave, then the menu option is disabled.</p>
<p>"Delete Selection" replaces the selected notes with rests. "Snip Selection" removes the selected notes, adding the appropriate amount of rest at the end of the channel. This operation always preserves the position of the loop point and end point.</p>
<p>"Split Note" is useful for changing note properties, such as volume envelope or vibrato, part way through a note. It places the split at the playhead's position.</p>
<p>With one or more notes selected, the Note Properties Panel opens. From here, the most common settings can be edited: Speed, Volume Envelope, Vibrato, and Duty Cycle/Wave/Drumkit. Use the "Advanced" button to edit the uncommon settings: Tempo, Transpose, and Pitch Slide. The remaining commands, such as Pitch Sweep, Pitch Offset, and Stereo Panning, are currently not supported by the editor, although those commands will be preserved if already part of an existing song file.</p>
<p>If more than one note is selected, an asterisk (*) will appear next to any property which has multiple distinct values among the selected notes. In such a case, the displayed value is that of the left-most selected note.</p>
<p>The up and down arrow buttons next to a property are applied immediately if clicked. If typing into a property text box, apply the change with the Enter key or cancel the change with the Escape key. The change will not be applied if the selected channel or selected notes are changed without pressing Enter.</p>
<p>The "Resize Song" dialog works just like the "New" dialog, but is used to adjust the length of each channel of the current song. The loop points can also be adjusted, if the song loops. If every length is a whole multiple of a beat then "Beats" will be preselected, otherwise "Ticks" will be selected. If all channels are already synchronized then the "Synchronize Channels" checkbox will be checked, otherwise it will be unchecked. When the OK button is clicked, every channel will be resized as necessary. If a channel is shortened and an inner loop or call no longer fits, it will be removed. The first iteration of an inner loop will be preserved as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Placing Notes</h3>
<p>The computer keyboard can also be used as a piano keyboard for placing notes. The key mapping is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>z</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;C</li>
<li><code>s</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;D♭/C♯</li>
<li><code>x</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;D</li>
<li><code>d</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;E♭/D</li>
<li><code>c</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;E</li>
<li><code>v</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;F</li>
<li><code>g</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;G♭/F♯</li>
<li><code>b</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;G</li>
<li><code>h</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;A♭/G♯</li>
<li><code>n</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;A</li>
<li><code>j</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;B♭/A♯</li>
<li><code>m</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;B</li>
<li><code>r</code>&nbsp;→&nbsp;Rest</li>
</ul>
<p>These shortcuts place the corresponding note at the playhead's current position and automatically advance the playhead to the next position. This isn't as convenient as Pencil Mode (explained below) but is useful as a keyboard-only alternative which doesn't require the mouse.</p>
<p>Use Backtick (`) to toggle Pencil Mode. While in Pencil Mode, left-click to place notes (instead of selecting notes). When a note is placed, it is automatically selected so that it may quickly be manipulated (ie, )" COMMAND_SHIFT_KEYS_PLUS RIGHT_SYMBOL R"( to lengthen the note) and have its properties edited. Right-click and drag to erase notes.</p>
<p>Newly placed notes will try to match the length and speed of the previous note, if it fits</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Since the mouse cannot be used to select notes while in Pencil Mode, it is useful to use the Enter key to manage the selection without needing to exit Pencil Mode.</p>
<h3>Loops and Calls</h3>
<p>Loops and calls can be created and modified via the context menu which can be brought up by right-clicking on the timeline.</p>
<p>To create a loop, select a span of notes and select Create Loop from the context menu or press )" COMMAND_SHIFT_KEYS_PLUS R"(C. To create a loop that starts or ends with a rest, place a temporary note at the intended start and/or end in order to have a "handle" on the span, then delete the temporary note(s) after the loop is created.</p>
<p>The number of times that a loop loops can be reduced with )" ALT_KEY_PLUS R"(- or extended with )" ALT_KEY_PLUS R"(=, as long as there is room for one more loop. Unroll Loop ()" COMMAND_SHIFT_KEYS_PLUS R"(X), will reduce the loop but leave the notes, so that they may be edited independently from the original loop.</p>
<p>Similarly, calls can be created by selecting a span of notes and pressing )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(C. Once a call is created, it is selected and ready to be inserted at other positions by moving the playhead to the desired location and pressing )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(V. Any other existing call can be selected by pressing )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(C while the playhead is inside the call, as long as no notes are selected. Calls can be deleted with )" ALT_KEY_PLUS R"(Backspace and unpacked with )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(X.</p>
<p>Loops can be created inside of a call, and calls can be created/inserted inside of a loop. But loops cannot be nested inside other loops, and calls cannot be nested inside other calls.</p>
<hr>
<h2>View</h2>
<p>The piano key pitch labels can be toggled with )" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(K. Pitch labels for every note can be toggled with )" COMMAND_SHIFT_KEYS_PLUS R"(K.</p>
<p>The Ruler (toggled with )" COMMAND_SHIFT_KEYS_PLUS R"(R) is also controlled by the grid spacing setting. The grid spacing can be adjusted to make the ruler better fit the speed or time signature of the song. Clicking into the measure ruler will also set the playhead if a song is opened.</p>
<p>The Zoom setting ()" COMMAND_KEY_PLUS R"(=) is useful when working with a sequence of very small notes.</p>
